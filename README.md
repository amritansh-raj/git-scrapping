# GitHub Search Tool

The GitHub Search Tool is a Python script that allows you to search for GitHub users or repositories based on a keyword. It uses the GitHub search API to fetch the results and provides you with relevant information about the search results.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this tool, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x)
- `requests` library (You can install it using `pip install requests`)
- `BeautifulSoup` library (You can install it using `pip install beautifulsoup4`)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script directly.

2. Run the script using the following command:

   ```python project.py```

3. You will be prompted to enter a keyword to search for.

4. You will also be prompted to choose between searching for users or repositories by entering '1' or '2', respectively.

5. The script will then fetch the search results from GitHub and display the relevant information.
